By completing this assignment you will:

- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.

- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
